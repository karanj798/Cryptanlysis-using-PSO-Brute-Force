A microwave is a kitchen appliance that cooks food by heating. Microwaves are very popular today and are found in almost every household. However microwaves are not safe appliances and can be dangerous to our health because they use radiation for heating food.
Radiation is used to make the food molecules move and vibrate therefore causing heat. But because the radiation is so powerful, it affects our health negatively in two ways. First of all, radiation changes the molecular structure of the food therefore reducing the amount of nutrients in the food. That is not helpful to us at all as we eat food to gain nutrients. And secondly, if the food is heated in a plastic container, the plastic could melt and release harmful gases or stick to the food you are eating. If swallowed, plastic could be harmful to the body.
Even though microwaves are widely popular these days, one must be aware of the negative consequences and dangers to avoid unnecessary injuries. One must wonder if the invention of the microwave is a blessing or a curse!
